# Party Push Backend Repo

Party Push is a web app (will be hosted in the future at https://www.livepartytracker.com) in development that crowdsources party and event management.

This backend uses the .NET6 framework (C# code) and the CQRS pattern. It writes to an AWS RDS instance. See "party-push-front-end" repo for the front end code.

Target v1 release date: December 4th, 2023.
